I am flying from the UK with my mum to the east coast. The original plan was for me to fly over to my boyfriend in the west coast (my parents are holidaying on the east coast) but because my mum was freaking out so much about me going to meet my boyfriend i said we can all road trip there together. I even invited her on the trip with us. I have given her all of our dates so that she can travel around with us.

The plan was for me to stay on the 4th July and fly back on the 5th. Mum knew this. I told her I had booked a flight back already from the west coast to east coast (where she would pick me up and we would fly back to the UK together). She has gone mad at me because she can't believe I would book a flight when she told me she didn't want me flying on my own. At the time I had booked it she told me she wasn't gonna road trip with us. She knew the trip was happening.......how else was I to get home if I don't fly? 

I am fine flying on my own it doesn't bother me at all. I feel like I have done everything I can to make her feel comfortable with this trip and she is just trying to sabotage it. Thoughts??",Mother [51] not speaking to me [21] because of a trip I am planning, I have made sure my mother is comfortable with my boyfriend travelling on a trip and now my mother is mad because I booked it., Mum is mad at me for not flying on my own trip to meet my boyfriend.,sup1,sup1,winner

Evidence: 
She used the same font and size that she uses for all her notes

We requested from the property management group to have the video tapes looked at and they stated hey did not have time to go on a ""wild goose chase"" I want evidence hard evidence and they denied me. 

I want to pursue this further particularly  with the human rights board of Canada based in harrassment and predjusice that goes against the human rights code. 

The letter calls us assholes, says we were raised in a barn, says because we are young we should be more competent, calls us pigs, days we make all the neighbours sick. 

It is defamatory as it was pasted for everyone to see. Also we were not born in Canada. 

Please see this website for your information on his situation.  

Also this letter was taped on our door for everyone to see. It was prejudice and defamatory on many levels Adressed in the the human rights code of Manitoba. It was defamation of character for it to be visible To everyone. Please see the following ""
It is also contrary to The Code for anyone responsible for rental housing to knowingly permit or fail to take reasonable steps to terminate harassment of one participant by another participant - such as harassment of one tenant by another tenant.

I think if I cop to the snooping, we might have a more honest conversation about what's actually going on (if something is) and why she's having these feelings so we can either work through it together (my preference) or move on.  But obviously, it will open the pandora's box of the snooping.

I have booked a flight with AC live cargo to ship my dog from Toronto to San Franciso on August 10th. I thought I had all my ducks in a row but when I went to get the ""international health certificate for dogs and cats"" given to me by my regular vet signed by an ""official Canadian food inspection agency veterinarian"" they laughed at me and said this form is not needed to go to the US. (I do have the rabies vaccination certificate)

The CFIA said the health certificate that is required is just a statement from my regular vet stating age, breed, etc of the dog and that it is fit for travel. 

But my vet has said that people were turned away from traveling to the states because they *did not* have the form I mentioned above. I called the airline and they didn't know if it was the official form or just a statement from the vet. 

Can somebody please clarify?? Did you require this official ""international health certificate for dogs and cats"" to send your dog to the US or just a letter and rabies vaccination?

I know that lots of people often feel confused when they come out of a long-term relationship. They think they have forgotten how to be single, or how to flirt/date.

I am one of these people.

The problem is, my relationship started when I had just turned 16. I have never been single - as an adult. That might sound silly. But the only time I have ever flirted or dated was as an over-confident, hormone-riddled teenager.

Now I have a pretty demanding job, responsibilities blah blah... And I just don't know how to this!

I'm no way in a rush to get into a new relationship, but that doesn't mean I want to be completely alone in the mean time.

If anyone has experienced anything similar, or just generally has some advice, it would be greatly appreciated!",I [23F] have just come out of 8 year relationship.
